    What joy, to be of human birth!
We’ve made this world our home
more deep-ly than all life on Earth
that we al-low to roam.
Our hu-man rights and peace al-low
us time to sing this tune
and gave us where we’re sing-ing now
and foot-prints on the Moon!
And there-fo-re on-ly we a-mong
all life on Earth should ask:
what led us when we grew so rich
we take our world to task?
